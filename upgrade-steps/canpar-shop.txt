this procedure is for minor patches and hotfixes only!!!

• update statistics of tables sysindexes and syspartitions on all databases
• ensure you have fresh database backups of all databases
• if possible, run dbcc checkalloc on all databases before the upgrade
• make sure the standby server has the most recent data (for replication and HA setups)
• If upgrading the production server, backup and disable cron jobs on IQ, Production and RepServer and dataStage jobs
	• to backup cron jobs  crontab -l > crontab_backup.txt
	• to backup data stage jobs run the script C:\loomis_ftp_scripts\mail_scheduled_tasks.ps1 on hqvdstage1


extract data from the compressed file with: tar -zxvf ASESERV160003P_6-20012052.TGZ

disable replication alerts (disable crontab on replication server)
stop Backup Server: issue a "shutdown SYB_BACKUP" within isql
stop ASE: issue a "shutdown" within isql
stop XP Server if necessary (execute showserver on linux to see if it is started)
stop SCC  if present
stop Cockpit if present
stop repserver if present

cd /home/sybase/db_backups/ebf28334
./setup.bin -i console

Before running updatease, start the servers using (wait for recovery to complete for all databases): 
cd /opt/sap/ASE-16_0/install
startserver -f RUN_CPDB2 -f RUN_CPDB2_BS

Check if all databases are in read-write mode (the following query must return 0 rows): select master..sysdatabases where status & 1024 = 1024

in case some database does not upgrade succesfully, correct the errors (see the upgrade log) and then run: /opt/sap/ASE-16_0/bin/updatease -D/opt/sap -SCPDB2

reenable replication crontab
enable cron jobs and dataStage jobs
to restore cron jobs from the backup file run "crontab -r" and then "crontab crontab_backup.txt". To confirm the restore check "crontab -l"
reenable cron jobs on IQ, Production and RepServer and Data Stage jobs
