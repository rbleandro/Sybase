--Following are the steps to check if a database was added to the replication server. Do this before anything else to confirm that you have to run the rs_init command to add the replication agent
--============================================================================================================================================================================================================
in Primary db (rev_hist):
--==============
use rev_hist
go
sp_reptostandby rev_hist,'all'
go
sp_setrepdbmode rev_hist,uds,'off' --<-- Keeping it off
go
sp_config_rep_agent rev_hist,disable --this will return an error if replication has never been configured for the database
go
--====
-- In Secondary db
--===
use rev_hist
go
sp_reptostandby rev_hist,'all'
go
sp_setrepdbmode rev_hist,uds,'off' --<-- Keeping it off
go
sp_config_rep_agent rev_hist,disable --this will return an error if replication has never been configured for the database

--Following steps are to start replicating a new database that has never been configured for replication before.
--============================================================================================================================================================================================================
--Configure replication for all databases through rs_init. The rs_init will create the threads for the log reader agent and create the logical connection to the specified database.
--Make sure you specify the correct values for parameter rs.rs_needs_repagent according to your setup.

--If you set dsi_compile_enable off, Replication Server uses continuous log-order, row-by-row replication mode
--Enable dsi_replication_ddl to replicate DDL statements.
--Disable dsi_keep_triggers to prevent Adaptive Server from firing triggers for the replicated transactions, thereby preventing duplicate updates in the standby database
--dist_sqt_max_cache_size defines The maximum Stable Queue Transaction (SQT) cache size for the DIST connection.
--Dynamic SQL allows the Replication Server Data Server Interface (DSI) to prepare dynamic SQL statements at the target user database and to run them repeatedly.

--ATTENTION! DROP ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT POINT TO THE CONNECTION BEFORE DROPPING THE CONNECTION. IF THE CONNECTION IS TO A PRIMARY DATABASE, ALSO DROP ANY REP DEFINITIONS.
