Add the following to the interfaces file: the primary SAP ASE, the replicate SAP ASE, the SAP Replication Server, and the server containing the RSSD database (in this case embedded):

VREPHOME_RS
   master tcp ether !!HOSTIPHERE!! 11752

cd $SYBASE/REP-15_5/init/rs

Modify the parameter values in VREPHOME.rs file. Check the file replication-server-initial-build-configuration-file.txt for more details.

#remove any partition files previously created(in case you're installing replication server for the first time or reinstalling the product)

/***************** UPGRADE STEPS ************************/

#backup the erssd 
sysadmin erssd, backup

#Shut down the preupgrade version of Replication Server.
ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep repserver

#Back up the entire set of files and directories under $SYBASE.
#download the desired version

#run the setup of the new version and point to the current version installation folder
./setup.bin -i console

#follow the prompts untill the end of the process

source $SYBASE/SYBASE.sh

#move and mirror log files to avoid "invalid files" errors
ls /opt/sybase/data/*.mlg #if this returns anything, move these files somewhere else
mkdir /opt/sybase/data/old
mv /opt/sybase/data/*.mlg /opt/sybase/data/old/

#if you are performing a major version upgrade copy the contents from one install folder to the other and edit them to point to the new version

cp *.* ../../REP-16_0/install
cp RUN_VREPHOME_RS ../../REP-16_0/install

#grant the sa_role to every db_maint user in both PDBs and RDBs (example below)

#do one of the commands below depending on the new version
cd /opt/sybase/REP-15_5/install/  
cd /opt/sybase/REP-16_0/install/

#now start the replication server
./RUN_VREPHOME_RS 

#Check the upgraded Replication Server
#Verify that the RSSD or ERSSD version of the upgraded Replication Server is correct.
#You can check one of:
#Replication Server error log – you see: Upgraded RSSD successfully. The current RSSD version is '1600003'.
#rs_config table – log in to isql and enter:
select * from rs_config where optionname='current_rssd_version'

#Check that the Replication Server modules are running by executing admin who with the relevant options.

#revoke the sa_role granted before
revoke role 'sa_role' from dba_maint

#test the replication emiting a rs_ticket or doing simple writes to one PDB
