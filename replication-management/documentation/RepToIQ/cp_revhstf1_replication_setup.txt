Steps to Setup IQ Replication for a database:

--First section only applies to IQ and SRS tuning params
in SRS on IQ connection from SRS
dsi_cmd_batch_size – number of bytes sent in a batch.  Default of 8192 is typically too small.  A good start is 65536.
dsi_compile_max_cmds – Be sure this is large enough for large transactions, otherwise, RTL may not be used.  Use 200,000 to start.
dsi_cdb_max_size -- set this high as well, so not hit IQ with constant transactions from SRS. -- Start with 10240
dsi_compile_enable -- also should be enabled

-- See the command below...for all connection settings

In IQ:
Minimize_storage = ‘on’ – be sure to turn this parameter on either globally or at the beginning of your DDL scripts.  This will enable optimized FP[1-3] index creation.  (see FP index rollover discussion below)
Append_Load = ‘on’ – Its recommended to turn this for RTL performance.  This option prevents IQ from filling in the blank spaces in indexes. Instead, IQ will append to the end of indexes.  Some caution and monitoring (sp_iqindexframentation for non-FP) is required since table fragmentation can occur.
set option public.Append_Load = 'On'

1a- Create user for that database: eg rev_hist (For canpar dbs)
CREATE USER rev_hist_rep1 IDENTIFIED BY sybase;
GRANT ROLE DBA TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT ROLE readers TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT ROLE PUBLIC TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT ROLE dbo TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT DELETE ANY TABLE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT INSERT ANY TABLE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT UPDATE ANY TABLE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT CREATE ANY OBJECT TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT TRUNCATE ANY TABLE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT LOAD ANY TABLE TO rev_hist_rep1 WITH NO ADMIN OPTION;
COMMENT ON USER rev_hist_rep1 IS 'User is used for IQ replication from rev_hist';

2- Create connection for the IQ in SRS for that db

create connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1 
using profile rs_ase_to_iq;standard
set username to rev_hist_rep1
set password to sybase
go

-- Alter the connection to enable HVAR
alter connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1 set dsi_compile_enable to 'on'
alter connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1 set dsi_cmd_batch_size to '65536' 
alter connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1 set dsi_compile_max_cmds to '200000'
alter connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1 set dsi_cdb_max_size to '10240'
suspend connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1
resume connection to CPIQ.rev_hist_iq_conn1

*****************--Example of setting a table for replication to IQ--****************************************

-- Tips : Points to remember
-- decimal datatype with precision and scale, eg: decimail(6,1) should be replaced with decimal in repdef
-- All bits should be converted to int in IQ, or replication will stack trace

drop replication definition iq_revhstf1_rep

create replication definition iq_revhstf1_rep
with primary at CPDB1.rev_hist
with primary table named dbo.revhstf1
with replicate table named dbo.revhstf1

--Very important, if a table has a keyword such as cube, we need to add quoted in the column specification.

-- and once the initial load completes, data will get in sync. But, you will need to set i2di and u2di
-- Because the subscription does not know that there is data already there in replicate, it will also
-- complain about row count mismatch, so we will need to ignore that for the duration of initial load and 
-- initial catch up of replicated trans in the queue
-- See below

-- You must add dbo to table name, since you are replicating with owner_on
